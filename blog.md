# Response to Johanna Drucker’s Humanities Approach to Graphical Display
  “What digital humanists do depend largely on academic discipline but also on level of technical expertise. Each discipline, with varying degrees of intensity, has over the years developed a set of favored methods, tools and interests that, although shared with other disciplines remains connected to the discipline” (Rafael Alvarado). 
  
  This post was designed to respond to a reading on the ‘Humanities Approaches to Graphical Display’ by Johanna Drucker. Considering that we exist in an era of technology, whereby, most tools used to either understand or acquire knowledge demands the need of a technological device. In abstract to Drucker’s article, it is stated that “digital humanists have adopted visualization tools in their work, they have borrowed methods developed for the graphical display of information in the natural and social sciences.” Here, we can therefore say that Drucker’s argument in this article is to point out “that we need a humanist’s approach to the graphical expression of interpretation.” I believe that the point of this argument is to prove the need of a humanist’s approach to the current situation which is not just following what technology gives you as an answer but concluding that we can derive an answer from a humanistic lens with the aid of technology. 
  
  Before I continue, I feel it is necessary for us to understand what ‘Visualization’ is and why it is gradually used more often as a tool in the humanities. Visualization is “the use of computer-supported, interactive, visual representations of abstract data to amplify cognition. It is also the graphical display of abstract information for two purposes: sense-making (also called data analysis) and communication” (hastac). In her article ‘Humanities Approaches to Graphical Display,’ Johanna discusses the importance of the representation of knowledge but also points out that the use of these newly found technology is causing impaired vision amongst humanists. She states that this “representation of knowledge is as crucial to its force as any other facet of its production…. but it seems to have produced a momentary blindness among practitioners who would never tolerate such literal assumptions in textual work” (Johanna). For example, as stated by Anderson “Let’s say we wanted a way of being able to view the flow and frequency of tweets in twitter feeds within a short period of time, how might we go about rendering this information in a comprehensive and efficient way? Without visualization tools, this feat would be rather difficult. You could measure the number of followers notified over time of various tweets, which could be illustrated using a traditional Cartesian graph, for instance, but this wouldn’t take into account that not all tweets are the same, thus eliminating the inherent individuality of tweets. Therefore, representing tweets with visualization presents the information in a more nuanced and situated way” (Anderson). 
  
  As Anderson stated, “without “Visualization tools,” this feat would be rather difficult. I as a humanities student agree with him because in my opinion, the importance of visualization is to provide a way to learn something about any data presented, but at the same time, “any transformation of non-trivial data into an image will leave out information,” (Kosara) which I believe is what Johanna is trying to depict in her article. Johanna states “Data are capta, taken not given, constructed as an interpretation of the phenomenal world, not inherent in it” (Johanna). “The word ‘data’ comes from Latin to mean “given,” whereas the word “capta” is derived from the Latin word “taken.” The idea of “capta” then better represents the humanistic method of knowledge production as situated, partial, and constitutive” (Anderson). From this example, we can see that certain issues arise. Although we can present something through a graph or pie chart, as humanists, we entirely don’t show all the information that is needed to cause the data to be represented as a category of interpretation because the representational force of the visualization is simply a picture of data.
  
  After further research, I believe I found the answer to Drucker’s main argument. In the re-published post from an invited response to a February 2014 MediaCommons question of the week: “How can we better use data and/or research visualization in the humanities?” Bethany Nowviskie responds by stating that “Neatline was carefully designed by humanities scholars and DH practitioners to emphasize what we found most humanistic about interpretive scholarship, and most compelling about small data in a big data world…. The platform itself is architected so as to allow multiple, complementary or even wholly conflicting interpretations to be layered over the same, core set of humanities data” (Bethany). She also states that “Neatline sees visualization itself as part of the interpretive process of humanities scholarship - not as an algorithmically-generated, push-button result or a macro-view for distant reading – but as something created minutely, manually, and iteratively, to draw our attention to small things and unfold it there,” (Bethany) which I believe is what Johanna wants the Digital Humanities to comprehend. Personally, I believe she does not have an issue with “Visualization” as a tool, but has an issue with how humanists present data. If a humanist is going to present data, she expects that you find way to answer all how’s, whys, and what’s, before you present your data.
  
  In conclusion, “the task of the digital humanities, as a trans-curricular practice, is to bring these practitioners into communication with each other, and to cultivate a discourse that captures the shared praxis of bringing technologies of representation, computation, and communication to bear on the work of interpretation that defines the humanities” (Rafael Alvarado).
