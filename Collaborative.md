# Project Description:

The project/platform we worked on was titled “The Orlando Project.” It is an ongoing collaborative experiment in the use of computers to engage in literary history. It is a rich resource for researchers, for students, and for readers with interest in literature, women’s writing, or cultural history generally. Our research findings show the history of the project as well as its main goals. It was developed almost exclusively by scholars and graduate students at two universities in Canada (Alberta and Edmonton). Its main goal is to analyze and determine relationships between various texts, using encoding to identify specific materials of texts (e.g. a specific period, or location)


### Collaboration Statement

The collaboration between Anderson Ferneyhough, Gavin Kirk, and Gregory Osagie resulted in the successful completion of the Orlando Project. The approach adopted was to assign roles and responsibilities based on each team member’s strengths to research and gather materials required to complete the project.

I was assigned the responsibility to research the official website for the Orlando project to share the information with the rest of the team as well as find ways to access the platform. I was also responsible for introducing the group to the class as well as giving a short video to summarize what the project was all about to simplify the process of understanding by my peers.

Anderson, was assigned the role of the middle man, his task was to elaborate on how users could get to know more about the software. By demonstrating what the project is about as well as stating where it originated from, how it was developed, the main goals of the project, and its main features.

Gavin’s role was like that of sales person. His task was to enlighten potential users about who works on the project, how it was funded, how to gain access to the software, the effectiveness of subscribing, and finally comparing it to other possible encyclopedias.
Collaboration on this project enriched my academic thinking by improving my research skills which I will apply to my academic work and future projects. 

Digital materials used during this project include Google Slides.
