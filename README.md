## Bio

![](http://timmatic.com/i/2017/01/computer-network-wallpaper-1080p.jpg)

  I am an Interactive Arts and Science major student, in my second year. My specific research interests are:
  <ul>
    <li>	Artificial Intelligence through Digital Expression which involves using production tools to create discipline specific digital           artifacts, for example, 3D objects, text, images, animation, audio, applications, and video games.</li>
    <li>	Web and Internet Technologies through Digital Prototyping which demonstrates a knowledge of common programming languages, and           basic computing concepts or modes of thinking.</li>
    </ul>
  I have completed IASC 1P02 (Web Media Production) course, in which I designed a fully operational website about myself, as a demonstration of my expertise in digital prototyping. I also completed IASC 2P06 (3D Objects, Environments and Visualization) course, in which I designed a 3D model of a Modern Villa, using the MAYA program, as a demonstration of my expertise in digital expression. 
  
  
  In continuation of my research within digital humanities, I would like to address the issue of medical manpower shortage worldwide using Artificial Intelligence. I will research and develop a creative bot that can do a comprehensive diagnosis of a human body to identify malfunctioned organs and make prescriptions in right doses for healing. This will eliminate delays in seeking medical attention and reduce workload on medical personnel.

### Response to Johanna Drucker’s Humanities Approach to Graphical Display

### Abstract:

"What digital humanists do depend largely on academic discipline but also onlevel of technical expertise. Each discipline, with varying degrees of intensity, has over the years developed a set of favored methods, tools and interests that, although shared with other disciplines remains connected to the discipline" (Alvarado, 2011).

  It is necessary for us to understand what ‘Visualization’ is and why it is gradually used more often as a tool in the humanities. Visualization is “the use of computer-supported, interactive, visual representations of abstract data to amplify cognition. It is also the graphical display of abstract information for two purposes: sense-making (also called data analysis) and communication” (hastac).

  Considering that we exist in an era of technology, whereby, most tools used to either understand or acquire knowledge demands the need of a technological device, the aim of this argument is to emphasize the need to interpret information obtained from technological devices in conjunction with humanistic lens, and not just accept graphical displays as given.
 
  Digital humanists have adopted visualization tools in their work, they have borrowed methods developed for the graphical display of information in the natural and social sciences. Here, we can therefore say that Drucker’s argument in this article is to point out that we need a humanist’s approach to the graphical expression of interpretation.
 
  This article is intended for digital humanities students and its significance it to reiterate the importance of applying human reasoning to conclusion drawn based on results derived from technological support in the field. 
  
  
### Word Statement:

This research work started off as a class reading for the week of January 30, 2017. Being a collaborative work, we did not go in-depth, but the idea of the topic as well as explanation from the professor caught my attention.

The research topic is based on how visualization tools have been introduced into the digital humanities to reach conclusions on their work findings. With this development, it was found that technological, graphical information are being adopted as given without applying human reasoning. Drucker’s article reviewed in my blog tried to address this concern by stating that “the forms for graphical expression of capta need to be more nuanced to show ambiguity and complexity.”

As time passed by, we were asked to compose an academic blog that discusses a scholarly issue. The first topic that came to mind was Drucker’s article. To formulate this blog post, I researched other topics in the humanities field so as to create a core argument and an articulated firm stance. The blog post was a sum of nine hundred and twenty-two (922) words, in support of Drucker’s article.

To address the instructor’s feedback, I removed several quotes from the articles in my blog, and I used more of my own words to express my understanding of the research work and also not using one quotation to explain another.

By undertaking this project, I have developed a better understanding of how graphical display was introduced into digital humanities as a tool.
