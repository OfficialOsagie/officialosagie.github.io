## Bio

![](http://timmatic.com/i/2017/01/computer-network-wallpaper-1080p.jpg)

  I am an Interactive Arts and Science major student, in my second year. My specific research interests are:
  <ul>
    <li>	Artificial Intelligence through Digital Expression which involves using production tools to create discipline specific digital           artifacts, for example, 3D objects, text, images, animation, audio, applications, and video games.</li>
    <li>	Web and Internet Technologies through Digital Prototyping which demonstrates a knowledge of common programming languages, and           basic computing concepts or modes of thinking.</li>
    </ul>
  I have completed IASC 1P02 (Web Media Production) course, in which I designed a fully operational website about myself, as a demonstration of my expertise in digital prototyping. I also completed IASC 2P06 (3D Objects, Environments and Visualization) course, in which I designed a 3D model of a Modern Villa, using the MAYA program, as a demonstration of my expertise in digital expression. 
  
  In continuation of my research within digital humanities, I would like to address the issue of medical manpower shortage worldwide using Artificial Intelligence. I will research and develop a creative bot that can do a comprehensive diagnosis of a human body to identify malfunctioned organs and make prescriptions in right doses for healing. This will eliminate delays in seeking medical attention and reduce workload on medical personnel.
